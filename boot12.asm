;
; I)    BASIC features
;
;    This boot sector will load and start a real mode image from a file in the
; root directory of a FAT12 formatted floppy or partition.
;
;    Inputs:
; DL = drive number
;
;    Outputs:
; The boot record is left in memory at 7C00 and the drive number is patched
; into the boot record at 7C24.
; SS = DS = 0
; BP = 7C00
;_____________________________________________________________________________
;
; II)   Compiling and installing
;
;  To compile, use NASM
;
;  nasm boot12.asm -o boot12.bin
;
;  Then you must copy the first three bytes of BOOT12.BIN to the first three
;  bytes of the volume and copy bytes 0x3E through 0x1FF of BOOT12.BIN to
;  bytes 0x3E through 0x1FF of the volume.  Bytes 0x3 through 0x3D of the
;  volume should be set by a FAT12 format program and should not be modified
;  when copying boot12.bin to the volume.
;
;  If you use my PARTCOPY program to install BOOT12.BIN on A:, the
;  commands are:
;
;  partcopy boot12.bin 0 3 -f0
;  partcopy boot12.bin 3e 1c2 -f0 3e
;
;  PARTCOPY can also install to a partition on a hard drive.  Please read
;  partcopy documentation and use it carefully.  Careless use could overwrite
;  important parts of your hard drive.
;
;  You can find PARTCOPY and links to NASM on my web page at
;  http://www.erols.com/johnfine/
;_____________________________________________________________________________
;
; III)  Detailed features and limits
;
;   Most of the limits are stable characteristics of the volume.  If you are
; using boot12 in a personal project, you should check the limits before
; installing boot12.  If you are using boot12 in a project for general
; distribution, you should include an installation program which checks the
; limits automatically.
;
; CPU:  Supports any 8088+ CPU.
;
; Volume format:  Supports only FAT12.
;
; Sector size:  Supports only 512 bytes per sector.
;
; Drive/Partition:  Supports whole drive or any partition of any drive number
; supported by INT 13h.
;
; Diskette parameter table:  This code does not patch the diskette parameter
; table.  If you boot this code from a diskette that has more sectors per
; track than the default initialized by the BIOS then the failure to patch
; that table may be a problem.  Because this code splits at track boundaries
; a diskette with fewer sectors per track should not be a problem.
;
; File position:  The file name may be anywhere in the root directory and the
; file may be any collection of clusters on the volume.  There are no
; contiguity requirements.  (But see track limit).
;
; Track boundaries:  Transfers are split on track boundaries.  Many BIOS's
; require that the caller split floppy transfers on track boundaries.
;
; 64Kb boundaries:  Transfers are split on 64Kb boundaries.  Many BIOS's
; require that the caller split floppy transfers on track boundaries.
;
; Cluster boundaries:  Transfers are merged across cluster boundaries whenever
; possible.  On some systems, this significantly reduces load time.
;
; Cluster 2 limit:  Cluster 2 must start before sector 65536 of the volume.
; This is very likely because only the reserved sectors (usually 1) and
; the FAT's (two of up to 12 sectors each) and the root directory (usually
; either 15 or 32 sectors) precede cluster 2.
;
; Track limit:  The entire image file must reside before track 32768 of the
; entire volume.  This is true on most media up to 1GB in size.  If it is a
; problem it is easy to fix (see boot16.asm).  I didn't expect many people
; to put FAT12 partitions beyond the first GB of a large hard drive.
;
; Memory boundaries:  The FAT, Root directory, and Image must all be loaded
; starting at addresses that are multiples of 512 bytes (32 paragraphs).
;
; Memory use:  The FAT and Root directory must each fit entirely in the
; first 64Kb of RAM.  They may overlap.
;
; Root directory size:  As released, it supports up to 928 entries in the
; root directory.  If ROOT_SEG were changed to 0x7E0 it would support up
; to 1040.  Most FAT12 volumes have either 240 or 512 root directory
; entries.
;_____________________________________________________________________________
;
; IV)   Customization
;
;   The memory usage can be customized by changing the _SEG variables (see
; directly below).
;
;   The file name to be loaded and the message displayed in case of error
; may be customized (see end of this file).
;
;   The ouput values may be customized.  For example, many loaders expect the
; bootsector to leave the drive number in DL.  You could add "mov dl,[drive]"
; at the label "eof:".
;
;   Some limits (like maximum track) may be removed.  See boot16.asm for
; comparison.
;
;   Change whatever else you like.  The above are just likely possibilities.
;_____________________________________________________________________________


; Change the _SEG values to customize memory use during the boot.
; When planning memory use, remember:
;
; *)  Each of ROOT_SEG, FAT_SEG, and IMAGE_SEG must be divisible by 0x20
;
; *)  None of ROOT, FAT or IMAGE should overlap the boot code itself, or
;     its stack.  That means: avoid paragraphs 0x7B0 to 0x7DF.
;
; *)  The FAT area must not overlap the IMAGE area.  Either may overlap
;     the ROOT area;  But, if they do then the root will not remain in
;     memory for possible reuse by the next stage.
;
; *)  The FAT area and the root area must each fit within the first 64Kb
;     excluding BIOS area (paragraphs 0x60 to 0xFFF).
;
; *)  A FAT12 FAT can be up to 6Kb (0x180 paragraphs).
;
; *)  A FAT12 root directory is typically either 0x1E0 or 0x400 paragraphs
;     long, but larger sizes are possible.
;
; *)  The code will be two bytes shorter when FAT_SEG is 0x800 than when it
;     is another value.  (If you reach the point of caring about two bytes).
